<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>
  This is the most base C program; it prints a single line out to the console.
</p>
<p>
  There isn't much to say about this except that it gives you the very basics of
  C coding:
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Importing files is done via the "#include <name>" directive </li>
  <li> Functions are in the form [type] [name] ( [args] ) { ... } </li>
  <li> Programs are started by the 'main' function. </li>
  <li> Comments are contained in /* ... */ blocks. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Notice that main() is returning 0; that's a standard for 'no error'. 
  Typically if an error occurred, the output would be 1, or variety 
  of non-zero error codes to indicate different failure types.
</p>
<p>
  The printf() function is a part of the C standard library and it
  generally portable across all platforms. 
</p>
<p>
  There is no special significance to the /**

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  printf("Hello World\n");
  return 0;
}

Here's a very basic CMakeLists.txt that'll build this:

  It probably seems like overkill to be using CMake to build this program, when on a 
  unix system you can just as easily do it by going: <b>cc main.c</b>
</p>
<p>
  However, cmake has a couple of perks. For example, if you're using visual studio,
  simply choose 'visual studio project' as the cmake build type and it'll create a
  visual studio project to build the application.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the <b>file(GLOB_RECURSE [target] [pattern])</b> action is fantastically 
  useful for being able to sort your source files into various subdirectories and
  not have to manage them file-by-file.
</p>
<p>
  If you're using a unix based system, you should be able to build the project simply
  by running these commands in the hello-world directory:
</p>
<pre>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  ./hello
</pre>
<p>
  There are plenty of other build systems out there; use the one that make suits
  the purpose and environment you're using.
