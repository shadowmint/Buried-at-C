<h1>Working with python</h1>
<p>
  Working with python offers some great benefits; most specifically, unimportant
  application logic can easily be expressed in python, either for rapid prototyping
  or just for ease of maintainability.
</p>
<p>
  Interacting between python and c is very easy. First create a shared library,
  in this case its a simple set of # printing functions given by:
</p>
<pre>
  /** Print # map for each item in lengths, vertically. */
  int *print_vertical(int *lengths, int count);

  /** Print # map for each item in lengths, horizontally. */
  int *print_horizontal(int *lengths, int count);

  /** Print a total */
  void print_total(int *total);
</pre>
<p>
  In this case a simple CMakelists.txt will suffice for generating the
  shared library:
</p>
<pre>
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8)
  project(PYTEST)

  # Debug mode
  set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)
  if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX)
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-Wall -pedantic -Wimplicit-function-declaration -Wreturn-type -Wextra -g")
  endif()

  # Code type
  if(CMAKE_COMPILER_IS_GNUCXX)
    set(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} -std=c99")
  endif()

  # Sources
  file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES src/*.c)
  include_directories("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include")
  add_library(pytest SHARED ${SOURCES})

  # Process resulting library
  get_property(pytest_location TARGET pytest PROPERTY LOCATION)
  configure_file(pytest.py.in "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/pytest.py")
</pre>
<p>
  Notice the <b>configure_file</b> directive is used to generate a python 
  file with the location of the shared library in it:
</p>
<pre>
  def pytest():
    return "@pytest_location@"
</pre>
<p>
  Incidentally, yes, cmake is very nice in the way it allows this to be done as
  part of the build process, thank you for asking.
</p>
<pre>
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;printers.h&gt;

  /** Total thing */
  int __total;

  /** Print # map for each item in lengths, vertically. */
  int *print_vertical(int *lengths, int count) {
    
    __total = 0;

    /* for each item, print that many #'s */
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
      for (int j = 0; j < lengths[i]; ++j) {

      /* move to the next line. */
      printf("\n");
      __total += lengths[i];
    }

    return &__total;
  }

  /** Print # map for each item in lengths, horizontally. */
  int *print_horizontal(int *lengths, int count) {

    __total = 0;

    /* find the maximum height */
    int max = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
      __total += lengths[i];
      if (lengths[i] > max)
        max = lengths[i];
    }

    /* print #'s, line by line. */
    for (int line = max; line > 0; --line) {
      for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
        if (lengths[i] >= line)
          printf("#");
        else
          printf(" ");
      }
      printf("\n");
    }

    return &__total;
  }

  /** Print the total from a pointer */
  void print_total (int *total) {
    printf("Total: %d\n\n", *total);
  }
</pre>
<p>
  The implementation of the ABI isn't really particularly important, it's 
  just a few for loops; but notice how the functions return pointers. 
  This is not required, they could as easily return int or float types,
  but in this case it is to demonstrate the process of passing a pointer
  into a python context, and then back out into the c context.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that a new instance of the C program is not run when this occurs;
  the __total pointer retains its value across the calls to print_vertical()
  and to print_total()
</p>
<p>
  Invoking the code in python is two step process; first load the shared
  library using the ctypes.CDLL() call, and then invoke the functions as
  required.
</p> 
<p>
  In the python code the return and argument types of the c functions has
  been explicitly specified; this is unrequired in most circumstances, 
  but good practice to avoid passing incorrectly parameters to functions.
</p>
<pre>
  import os.path
  from ctypes import *
  from pytest import pytest

  library = pytest()
  pytest = CDLL(library)

  # Create a wrapper around our functions:
  class Printer(object):

    def __init__(self, native):
      self.native = native

      # int print_vertical(int *lengths, int count); 
      native.print_vertical.argtypes = [ POINTER(c_int), c_int ]
      native.print_vertical.restype = POINTER(c_int)

      # int print_vertical(int *lengths, int count);
      native.print_horizontal.argtypes = [ POINTER(c_int), c_int ]
      native.print_horizontal.restype = POINTER(c_int)

      # void print_total(int *value)
      native.print_total.argtypes = [ POINTER(c_int) ]

    def print_vertical(self, lengths):
      nl = (c_int * len(lengths))()
      for i in range(0, len(lengths)):
        nl[i] = lengths[i]
      rtn = self.native.print_vertical(nl, len(lengths))
      return rtn

    def print_horizontal(self, lengths):
      nl = (c_int * len(lengths))()
      for i in range(0, len(lengths)):
        nl[i] = lengths[i]
      rtn = self.native.print_horizontal(nl, len(lengths))
      return rtn

    def print_total(self, total):
      """ 
        There's no reason to pass the whole thing back to a 
        C function to print; this is function show off passing
        pointers around. If the return type was an int it 
        could just be printed by print(total) in python 
      """
      self.native.print_total(total)

  lengths = [6, 2, 3, 4, 6]

  p = Printer(pytest)

  print("Vertical:\n")
  total = p.print_vertical(lengths)
  p.print_total(total)

  print("Horizontal:\n")
  total = p.print_horizontal(lengths)
  p.print_total(total)

  There are various ways to achieve this, but <a href="http://www.swig.org/tutorial.html">SWIG</a> 
  is an easy way to generate a wrapper around your shared library without having to bind metadata
  manually.
